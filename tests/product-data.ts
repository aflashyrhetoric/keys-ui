      "This super-secure, compact, wireless keyboard has Matias Quiet-Click mechanical switches to give you the high performance of a mechanical keyboard without the noise normally associated with mechanical keyboards! The Secure Pro Keyboard uses Matias' new Quiet Click mechanical keyswitches, which were over 2 years in the making. They deliver a feel that is unmatched for comfort, without sacrificing the tactile feedback you need to type really fast. The keyboard is wireless via AES 128 bit encrypted 2.4 GHz Wireless RF with a nano receiver that you plug into the USB port of the computer; this means that the keyboard has the highest level of wireless security commercially available today - it's more secure than bluetooth - and is the level of security used by the government and highly secure corporate offices.  Also includes special anti-ghosting circuitry so that the keyboard keeps up with the fastest typists, laser etched keys so the characters don't wear off, and traditional sculpted keytops for comfort and speed. Keys are full sized, but there is no number pad, so the keyboard is smaller than a traditional keyboard.\r\n",

This is combined with premium gel palm supports that are bonded to Lycra, a short reach to the mouse due to an optimized keyboard layout, and Matias Quiet-Click mechanical switches with long key travel (3.5 mm) and a non-linear force curve (60g actuation force dropping off rapidly in a non-linear fashion) for an amazingly comfortable typing experience. Other special features include: sculpted keycaps for faster and more comfortable typing, laser-etched keys, a USB 2.0 hub, audio and media controls, special anti-ghosting circuitry, and a USB-C adapter pre-attached to the end of the USB-A cable, so that you can use this Mac keyboard directly plugged into the USB-C port on your newer Mac, or remove the adapter to use on your older Mac. Preset keyboard shortcuts, including dedicated keys for cut, copy, paste, and undo, are useful right out of the box, or you can easily reprogram these keys and many others without the need for software, to customize your keyboard for the way you work.",

      "The firmware has been completely redone with many new functions and features.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard supports complete layout re-programming. Love the Anne Pro 2 but miss the flexibility of using a QMK compatible board? No problem! All keys on the keyboard can be remapped to become any key you want through ObinsLab Starter.\r\n\r\nTap key functionality enables keys to behave differently when tapped or held. By default, Right shift, Fn1, Fn2, and Right control behave as arrow keys when tapped.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main function keys which can be remapped to your preference. Fn1 and  Fn2 can be mapped to two different function layers that can be customized through ObinsLab Starter. Caps Lock can also be set to act as a “Magic” function key to mirror the behavior of either Fn1 or Fn2. This “Magic” function is particularly useful to make certain functions easily accessible without moving your fingers from the home row. For example, while holding “Magic” function, WASD can behave as arrow keys.\r\n\r\nLighting can also be reprogrammed through ObinsLab Starter. RGB backlights are individually addressable and dynamic lighting effects can also be programmed as well. Lighting profiles can be created, saved, and loaded to the keyboard through the software.\r\n\r\nUp to 16 key macros can be programmed through the computer software. Saved macros are stored onto the keyboard onboard memory and do not need the use of the computer software to activate.\r\n\r\nKeyboard firmware updating is done entirely through ObinsLab Starter, and is much easier than compared to the process for the original Anne Pro. Just plug the USB cable into the board, press update, and the software will automatically download and transfer the firmware update to the board.",

      "The firmware has been completely redone with many new functions and features.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard supports complete layout re-programming. Love the Anne Pro 2 but miss the flexibility of using a QMK compatible board? No problem! All keys on the keyboard can be remapped to become any key you want through ObinsLab Starter.\r\n\r\nTap key functionality enables keys to behave differently when tapped or held. By default, Right shift, Fn1, Fn2, and Right control behave as arrow keys when tapped.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main function keys which can be remapped to your preference. Fn1 and  Fn2 can be mapped to two different function layers that can be customized through ObinsLab Starter. Caps Lock can also be set to act as a “Magic” function key to mirror the behavior of either Fn1 or Fn2. This “Magic” function is particularly useful to make certain functions easily accessible without moving your fingers from the home row. For example, while holding “Magic” function, WASD can behave as arrow keys.\r\n\r\nLighting can also be reprogrammed through ObinsLab Starter. RGB backlights are individually addressable and dynamic lighting effects can also be programmed as well. Lighting profiles can be created, saved, and loaded to the keyboard through the software.\r\n\r\nUp to 16 key macros can be programmed through the computer software. Saved macros are stored onto the keyboard onboard memory and do not need the use of the computer software to activate.\r\n\r\nKeyboard firmware updating is done entirely through ObinsLab Starter, and is much easier than compared to the process for the original Anne Pro. Just plug the USB cable into the board, press update, and the software will automatically download and transfer the firmware update to the board.",
