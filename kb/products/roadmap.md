# Roadmap

## v0 - The MVP
- Quiz
- Configurator 
	- lets you create, read, update, and delete saved keyboard builds 
	- creates shareable URLs
	- helps flag incompatibilities with helpful warnings and recommendations

## v1
- A dashboard view that allows you to view saved builds
- Configurator that can create, read, update, and delete saved builds with their own URLs

## v2 
- Keyboard sound index
- An index that groups YouTube videos by the keyboard/switch/keycap type/keycap profile/keycap material, etc, and lets you go through to see which ones you want to hear!

## v3
- A typing test
	- ie: sometimes blue switches (or whatever) can slow you down if you type at 120wpm+
