# Warnings

- Hot-swappable full-size keyboard, but the chosen 'extra keycaps' do not have enough pieces to replace all the switches (e.g. only a 10 pack, etc)
- Solder with hot-swappable keyboards
- Non MX stems with MX-stem style keycaps
- Lube but with no brush
- High profile keyboards with no wrist rest
