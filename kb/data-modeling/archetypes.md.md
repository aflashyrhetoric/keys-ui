# data models: archetypes & paradigms

## User Public & Internal Archetypes

We can categorize "user archetypes" by the general usage patterns that they boil down to.

These archetypes can inform ANY product recommendation, not just keyboards themselves. If you want to recommend a specific keycap for a poet, or a specific switch for creative people, do it.

## Remember:

- This is a recommendation engine. By default, we will NOT recommend products, so there's no need to make recommendations _against_ products yet.

For example: if you wanted to make a Rec that people who require quiet environments do NOT look at blue switches, you don't need to! Instead, just make a recommendation TO people who need quiet environments TO LOOK at silent switches!
